Enter the name and location of the MS Excel spreadsheet containing size information for particulate matter emissions for individual sources or for groups of sources at facilities with particulate emissions. Particulate deposition can only be modeled for facilities which have particles listed in the HAP emissions input file and those facilities must also be listed in the particle size file.
